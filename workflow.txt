# Android Project Build Fix Workflow

## Initial Issues
The GitHub Actions build was failing with several errors:

1. **AndroidX Dependencies Issue**:
   - Error: "Configuration `:app:debugRuntimeClasspath` contains AndroidX dependencies, but the `android.useAndroidX` property is not enabled"
   - The project was using AndroidX dependencies but didn't have the required configuration in gradle.properties.

2. **Android Gradle Plugin Warning**:
   - Warning: "We recommend using a newer Android Gradle plugin to use compileSdk = 34"
   - The project was using Android Gradle Plugin 8.1.0 which was tested up to compileSdk 33, but the project was using compileSdk 34.

3. **XML Namespace Issue**:
   - Error: "The prefix 'tools' for attribute 'tools:targetApi' associated with an element type 'item' is not bound"
   - The themes.xml files were using the tools namespace without declaring it.

4. **Android 12+ Manifest Issue**:
   - Error: "android:exported needs to be explicitly specified for element <activity#com.example.helloworld.MainActivity>"
   - Apps targeting Android 12 and higher require explicit android:exported attribute for components with intent filters.

5. **Deprecated Package Attribute**:
   - Warning: "Setting the namespace via the package attribute in the source AndroidManifest.xml is no longer supported"
   - The package attribute in AndroidManifest.xml is deprecated as the namespace is defined in build.gradle.

## Solutions Implemented

### Step 1: Create gradle.properties file
Created a gradle.properties file with the following key configurations:
- `android.useAndroidX=true` - Enabled AndroidX support
- `android.enableJetifier=true` - Added to automatically convert third-party libraries to use AndroidX
- `android.suppressUnsupportedCompileSdk=34` - Added to suppress warnings about using compileSdk 34 with AGP 8.1.0

### Step 2: Fix XML namespace issues
Added the tools namespace declaration to both theme XML files:
- app/src/main/res/values/themes.xml
- app/src/main/res/values-night/themes.xml

Changed:
```xml
<resources>
```
To:
```xml
<resources xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools">
```

### Step 3: Fix Android 12+ manifest requirements
Modified the AndroidManifest.xml to comply with Android 12+ requirements:
- Added android:exported="true" to the MainActivity declaration
- Removed the deprecated package attribute from the manifest tag

Changed:
```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.helloworld">
```
To:
```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
```

And:
```xml
<activity android:name=".MainActivity">
```
To:
```xml
<activity android:name=".MainActivity"
    android:exported="true">
```

### Step 4: Git operations
1. Added the new gradle.properties file to Git
2. Added the modified theme XML files to Git
3. Committed the changes with descriptive commit messages
4. Pushed the changes to GitHub

## Result
These changes resolved the build issues in the GitHub Actions workflow:
1. The AndroidX dependencies issue was fixed by enabling AndroidX support
2. The compileSdk warning was suppressed
3. The XML namespace issue was fixed by properly declaring the tools namespace
4. The Android 12+ manifest requirements were addressed by adding android:exported attribute
5. The deprecated package attribute was removed from the AndroidManifest.xml

## Key Takeaways
1. Always ensure proper namespace declarations in XML files
2. Configure gradle.properties appropriately for AndroidX projects
3. Be aware of Android Gradle Plugin version compatibility with compileSdk versions
4. For Android 12+ (API level 31+), explicitly set android:exported for components with intent filters
5. Use the namespace in build.gradle instead of package attribute in AndroidManifest.xml
## Subsequent Build Issues & Fixes (After Initial Fixes)

### Issue 6: Missing Mipmap Resources
- **Error:** Android resource linking failed, resource `mipmap/ic_launcher` and `mipmap/ic_launcher_round` not found.
- **Cause:** The `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` referenced `android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher"` and `android:roundIcon="@mipmap/ic_launcher_round"`, but the corresponding `mipmap-*` resource directories and files were missing from `app/src/main/res/`.
- **Solution:** Removed the `android:icon` and `android:roundIcon` attributes from the `<application>` tag in `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.

### Issue 7: JVM Target Mismatch (Java vs. Kotlin)
- **Error:** Execution failed for task ':app:compileDebugKotlin'. 'compileDebugJavaWithJavac' task (current target is 1.8) and 'compileDebugKotlin' task (current target is 17) jvm target compatibility should be set to the same Java version.
- **Cause:** The Kotlin compiler was set to target JVM 17 (via `kotlinOptions`), but the Java compiler defaulted to target 1.8. The GitHub Actions runner was using Java 17.
- **Solution:** Added a `compileOptions` block within the `android` block in `app/build.gradle` to explicitly set the Java source and target compatibility to Java 17, matching the Kotlin target and the runner's Java version.
  ```gradle
  compileOptions {
      sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_17
      targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_17
  }
  ```
- **Git Note:** Ensured changes were staged (`git add`), committed (`git commit`), and pushed (`git push`) correctly to trigger the GitHub Actions workflow.
### Issue 8: Build Artifact (APK) Not Uploaded
- **Problem:** The GitHub Actions workflow completed successfully, but the generated APK file was not available for download as an artifact.
- **Cause:** The `.github/workflows/android.yml` file was missing a step to upload the build output using the `actions/upload-artifact` action.
- **Solution:** Added a final step to the `build` job in `.github/workflows/android.yml` to upload the debug APK.
  ```yaml
    - name: Upload Debug APK
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: app-debug-apk # Name of the artifact on GitHub
        path: app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk # Path to the generated APK
  ```
- **Note:** Corrected YAML indentation errors that occurred during the initial attempt to add this step.
